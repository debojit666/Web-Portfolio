           <h3>Applied Mathematics & Machine Learning Student</h3>
            <p>The domain of 'Machine Learning' and the mathematics behind it is somewhat of a new found interest for me and it is something that I never knew I had in me
            while growing up. My interest grew after I got admitted to the applied mathematics program at University of Applied Sciences Mittweida. Before that, I
            had a very counter intuitive approach towards math. However, after coming to know it better, I have learned to
            appreciate it in a new light. The minuscule nuance of the subject has really opened up a new world in front of me.</p>
